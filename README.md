## Description
Admittedly, many applications exist that track meals, diets, and provide recipes, however most do not have mules. Whilst mules may be a marketing shtick, shitcks garner attention, but are also useful. To wit: mules carry what are essential. We all have favorite meals, and avidly repeat them for lack of creativity, but once and awhile a new culinary exoticism is introduced that becomes a new go-to in your kitchen. This is where Meal Mule comes in. We  analyze your diet, BMI, and preferance for ingredients and calorie intake, then suggest meals/recipes tailered to your preferences. You can easily "pack your mule" with these new meals/recipes and add it to your culinary and dietary journey, without the burden of research and planning. 

Developing Meal Mule challenged us to use unfamiliar applications, such as Adobe In-Design, Miro, and unique APIs, all whilst corralling the team toward a common goal. Planning, we found out, save a lot of development time. When multiple poeple work simulatenously on discrete portions of the same application, the potential for accidentally deviating conceptually from the common goal multiplies per person involves, so communication and regular team meetings are essential.
